# Subject Quiz App
## Description: A menu was added to the application so that users may choose an automobile from a drop-down list and view its details below. To choose the car's color from the three available options, add a radio button. The "Purchase" button will take you to a new page with the details and price of the selected car displayed. The Buy button will cause the Fragment dialog to open, displaying the car's purchase confirmation. Include a feature that displays a message if no car is selected.
The user interface includes key elements such as a spinner for selecting car models, an 
ImageView for displaying car images, TextViews for detailed information, and RadioButtons for color choices. 
Buttons are used for initiating purchases and navigating between different app pages
